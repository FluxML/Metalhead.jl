# Arguments

  - `planes`: the number of planes in the block

    and/or the channel mixing MLP as a ratio to the number of planes in the block.
  - `mlp_layer`: the MLP layer to use in the block
  - `dropout_rate`: the dropout rate to use in the MLP blocks
  - `drop_path_rate`: Stochastic depth rate
  - `activation`: the activation function to use in the MLP blocks
