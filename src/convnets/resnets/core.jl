### ResNet blocks
## These functions return a block to be used inside of a ResNet model.
## The individual arguments are explained in the documentation of the functions.
## Note that for these blocks to be used by the `_make_blocks` function, they must define
## a dispatch `expansion(::typeof(fn))` that returns the expansion factor of the block 
## (i.e. the multiplicative factor by which the number of channels in the input is increased).
## The `_make_blocks` function will then call the `expansion` function to determine the
## expansion factor of each block and use this to construct the stages of the model.

# Arguments

        a deeper stem with 3 successive 3x3 convolutions having normalisation layers after each
        one. This is followed by a 3x3 max pooling layer with stride 2.
      + `:deep_tiered`: A variant of the `:deep` stem that has a larger width in the second
        convolution. This is an experimental variant from the `timm` library in Python that
        shows peformance improvements over the `:deep` stem in some cases.

  - `inchannels`: The number of channels in the input.
  - `replace_stem_pool`: Whether to replace the default 3x3 max pooling layer with a

This function creates the layers for many ResNet-like models. See the user guide for more
information.

!!! note
    
    If you are an end-user trying to use ResNet-like models, you should consider [`ResNet`](#)
    and similar higher-level functions instead. This version is significantly more customisable
    at the cost of being more significantly more complicated.

# Arguments

  - `block_fn`: The type of block to use inside the ResNet model. Must be either `:basicblock`,
    which is the standard ResNet block, or `:bottleneck`, which is the ResNet block with a
    bottleneck structure. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) for more details.

  - `layers`: A list of integers specifying the number of blocks in each stage. For example,
    `[3, 4, 6, 3]` would mean that the network would have 4 stages, with 3, 4, 6 and 3 blocks in
    each.
  - `downsample_opt`: Downsampling options. This can be any one of the following:
    
      + A single `Symbol` specifying the downsample option to use for all stages. The default
        is :B, which corresponds to a 1x1 convolution-based downsample for every stage except
        the first, which uses an identity projection. The other options are `:A`, which uses
        an identity projection for all stages, `:C`, which uses a convolution-based
        downsample for all stages and `:D`, which uses a max-pooling-based downsample for every
        stage except the first, which uses an identity projection. `:A`, `:B` and `:C` are
        are described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), while `:D` is
        described in the [Bag of Tricks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187) paper.
      + A `Vector` of `Symbol`s specifying the downsample options to use for each stage. The
        choices are the same as the single option above. The length of this `Vector` must be
        the same as the length of `layers`.
      + A `Vector` of `NTuple{2}`s specifying the downsample functions to use for each stage.
        The functions have to be passed in directly here - see [`downsample_identity`](#),
        [`downsample_conv`](#), and [`downsample_pool`](#). The first element of each tuple is
        the downsample function to use for the first stage, and the second element is the
        function to use for the rest of the stages. The length of this `Vector` must be the
        same as the length of `layers`.
  - `nclasses`: The number of output classes.
  - `inchannels`: The number of input channels.
  - `output_stride`: The total stride of the network i.e. the amount by which the input is
    downsampled throughout the network. This is used to determine the output size from the
    backbone of the network. Must be one of `[8, 16, 32]`.
  - `stem`: A constructed ResNet stem, passed in to be used in the model. `inplanes` should be
    set to the number of output channels from this stem. Metalhead provides an in-built
    function for creating a stem (see [`resnet_stem`](#)) but you can also create your
    own (although this is not usually necessary).
  - `inplanes`: The number of output channels from the stem.
  - `block_args`: A `NamedTuple` that may define none, some or all the arguments to be passed
    to the block function. For more information regarding valid arguments, see
    the documentation for the block functions ([`basicblock`](#), [`bottleneck`](#)).
  - `drop_rates`: A `NamedTuple` that may define none, some or all of the following:
    
      + `dropout_rate`: The rate of dropout to be used in the classifier head.
      + `drop_path_rate`: Stochastic depth implemented using [`DropPath`](#).
      + `drop_block_rate`: `DropBlock` regularisation implemented using [`DropBlock`](#).

!!! note
    
        `drop_path_rate` and `drop_block_rate` are not implemented for all choices of
        `block_fn`. In particular, [`bottle2neck`](#) blocks (used for [`Res2Net`](#)) do not
        support `drop_path_rate` or `drop_block_rate`.

  - `classifier_args`: A `NamedTuple` that **must** specify the following arguments:
    
      + `pool_layer`: The pooling layer to use in the classifier head. Pass this in with the
        arguments to the layer defined. For example, if you want to use an adaptive mean pooling
        layer, you would pass in `AdaptiveMeanPool((1, 1))`.
      + `use_conv`: Whether to use a 1x1 convolutional layer in the classifier head instead of a
        `Dense` layer.
